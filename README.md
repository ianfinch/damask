# Generate Damask Backgrounds

Generate tiles based on damask SVGs, then put the tiles together to form backgrounds.

## Build

Use the `make` command to generate the backgrounds

## Colour Combinations

The `colours.txt` file contains the colour combinations to generate.  Add more
colour pairs to this file to generate further combinations.

## Dependencies

- Needs my [svg2png](https://github.com/ianfinch/svg2png) container for the conversion from SVG to PNG
- Uses the _Pinyon Script_ font for the text in the background
